        Welcome to FRC-Scouting!
        \n\n
        This app was developed by me (Nathan) to send scouting data to our SQL database over Bluetooth.
        If at any point while using the app you have a question feel free to contact me.
        \n\n
        To report a bug with this app go to https://github.com/IBXCODECAT/FRC-Scouting/issues and open an Issue.
        \n\n
        I genuinely hope that the FIRST robotics 2022 season goes well for you all and that you all have a great time at competition!
